          <h2>Who are we in the next 15 years?</h2>
          <p>With the appearance of different individuals with unique personalities, but the same passion for coding, Sandbox Technology is a team of 5 members where we explore and get creative with coding, which is what we are all passionate about. Sandbox is like a shallow box in the ground party filled with sand for children to play in, have fun without pain because it wouldn’t hurt if you tripped or fell into the sand pit, which fits with our goals. But for Sandbox Technology, it doesn't just mean a shallow box for us to play on. It also means an isolated testing environment that allows users to run programs without affecting the application or platform, making it relevant to our passion: coding.<br><br>Thanks to Codeavengers, Sandbox Technology was able to level up their coding skills into another level, learning different language codes, UI designs, computer science, programming, and more, so we can apply our knowledge and understanding to our upcoming projects to help and benefit people around us.

          <p>Salutations, I'm Anh Duong. Before the New Zealand Future Skills Camp, I hated coding. I found the task very difficult and tiresome owing to the repetitive patterns. Due to the organizers' hard effort, coding no longer seems uninteresting or simple. Since I received all the help I needed, I felt like I had advanced. I'm delighted to share my programming enthusiasm now that I'm in this camp.

             Now, I'll include some of my academic accomplishments alongside those of my team colleagues. Now, I'll include some of my academic accomplishments alongside those of my team colleagues. In addition to having been recognized as an outstanding student at Vinschool once and being recognized as an excellent student twice, I also have a passion for basketball and have been awarded the trophy for <strong>winning the Hanoi City Primary School Basketball Championship</strong>. Not only did I win the basketball championship, but I also won many other school awards too!
            </p>
            <p>In fifteen years, despite the fact that I have a strong passion for basketball, one of the careers that I continue to hope to achieve is that of a doctor. Just like a lot of other individuals, I have a person in my life that serves as an example for me and who I look up to as a role model. That is my grandfather, or my grandfather's brother. However, I'm not going to be introducing her to anyone today. What I actually want to achieve is a dream of being wealthy, of being admired, and most importantly, a passionate drive to save a patient's life. This is what I want to do. The direction I'm aiming to head in is neither close nor far away from where I am now. It is essential for me to have a strong background in both physics and mathematics if I am to succeed in my career as a physician. As a result, taking part in the New Zealand Future Skill Camp will assist me in thinking in a more sophisticated and mature manner. By the way, I would also like to extend my gratitude to the event's organizers for providing us with the chance to test out new things and unveil our true selves, along with the company of other CodeAvengers and instructors!</p>

             In a nutshell, I am committed to providing me the hope and drive to leave a mark on people who come after me and the globe so that they may genuinely understand the true beauty of sport, jobs, and programming. This is the driving force behind my dedication.</p>

          <p>“Dare to dream large, for living without dreams is like having a body without a spirit”, as Invajy once remarked. Through this project, Who Are We in New Zealand Future Skill Camp, I get a chance to develop my own brain, force it to think about the future, get to draw and be creative about my successful dreams, and generate an entire map. I devote hours thinking and brainstorming ideas for the future, precisely from the minute to the hour, what my big dream is, and how I can reach my goals. Greetings to Everyone! I'm Thu Giang from the Sandbox Junior Tech Club group, and I consider myself really fortunate to have been made aware of this intriguing contest in order to fully engage myself in the field of information technology.

             My passion for coding has brought me to the Future Skills Camp in New Zealand. When I first learned about the computer programme Scratch in first grade, I became fascinated in it. I entered a competition and took first place in the STEM FAIR. I want to discover more Python and C++, and understand New Zealand's educational system and its development in informatics.
              <p>
In the future world in the year 2038, my 27th birthday, I have a desire to become a successful doctor, apply AI [ Artificial Intelligent ] technologies, modern technology in medicine, cure dangerous diseases such as smallpox, polio, leprosy, cancer (late stage), HIV,... to contribute to building a growing world. My biggest dream is that I can intervene in the current headache problem: environmental pollution, ecological imbalance. In the future, I will be able to apply technology to create an effective water purifier, filter the air or plant trees, or a car that does not emit smoke. In it are environmentally friendly scientific products. With a future full of money and success, I hope to be able to contribute to the education industry, reinvest in New Zealand education programs, as a return, giving access to many children. contact with CodeAvengers, a great application if the future wants to be oriented to information technology and programming, creating a better learning environment for the younger generation.

              In 15 years, I would really want to be a successful CEO of a AI company, because in the future, Artificial intelligence will be really popular and a lot of big companies and brands will need it. The reason is because AI can do work that needs a deep understanding of artificial intelligence algorithms, programming language, and data analysis. AI I can also help people in the medical field, Ai can help humans to analyze the illness that the patient has. Artificial Intelligence is also better for humans who have depression because they can know what they need.
